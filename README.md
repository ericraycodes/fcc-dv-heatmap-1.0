Visualizing dataset as heat map. The third certification project of freeCodeCamp's Data Visualization Course.

## Workflow
 1. Prepared the project's name and directory.
 1. Prepared the necessary source files: html, js, css.
 1. Created a remote git repository for version control throughout development.
 1. Secured the necessary CDNs: D3 library and fCC test suite.
 1. Built the HTML structure of the project.
 1. Coded the logic of the project with JavaScript and D3 library.
 1. The CSS styles are added along the way when needed.
 1. Conducted tests throughout development features and phases via the fCC test suite.
